Module 15 Challenge
Contributor: MaiDao Lor


## Challenge Oveview
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

In this module challenge, I will be developing a way to visulaize the USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and government organizations ( and hopefuly secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Visulation
In the Leafflet-Part-1 file we'll use the data from the GeoJSON website (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) to create the Earthquake Visualtion.

1. We're going to get our dataset from the GeoJSON link M1.0+ Earthquakes.
2. Import and visualize the data by doing the following:
    
    * Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude

        * The data markers will reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes will appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth will appear darker in color.
    
    * Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.

I have not started working on the Leaflet-Part-2 file. This part is optional and I will try to come back to it when I have the time.
